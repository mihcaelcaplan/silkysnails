In the wake of Michel Foucault's death in '984. there was an explosion
of scholarship on the body and its social construction. on the operations
of biopower. These genealogical (in the Nietzschean sense) studies exposed the various micropolitical and macropolitical techniques through
which the human body was disciplined. normalized. sped up and slowed
down. gendered. sexed. nationalized. globalized. rendered disposable.
or otherwise composed. The initial insight was to reveal how cultural
practices produce what is experienced as the "natural; but many theorists also insisted on the material recalcitrance of such cultural productions.' Though gender. for example. was a congealed bodily effect of
historical norms and repetitions. its status as artifact does nat imply
an easy susceptibility to human understanding. reform. or control. The
point was that cultural forms are themselves powerful. material assem·
blages with resistant force.
In what follows, I too, will feature the negative power or recalcitrance
of things. But I will also seek to highlight a positive. productive power of
their owo. And. instead of fOCUSing on collectives conceived primarily
2 chapter 1
as conglomerates of human designs and practices ("discourse"), I will
highlight the active role of nonhuman materials in public life. In short, I
will try to give voice to a thing-power. N; W. J. T. Mitcbell notes, "objects
are the way things appear to a subject-that is, with a name, an identity,
a gestalt or stereotypical template .... Things, on the other hand, ...
[signal] the moment when the object becomes the Other, when the sardine can looks back, when the mute idol speaks, when the subject experiences the object as uncanny and feels the need for what Foucault
calls 'a metaphysics of the object, or, more exactly, a metaphySics of that
never objectifiable depth from which objects rise up toward our superficial knowledge.""
Thing-Power, or the Out-Side
Spinoza ascribes to bodies a peculiar Vitality: "Each thing [res], as far
as it can by its own power. strives [conatur] to persevere in its own
being.'" Conotus names an "active impulsion" or trending tendency to
persist.' Although Spinoza distinguishes the human body from other
bodies by noting that its "virtue" consists in "nothing other than to live
by the guidance of reason,"' every nonhuman body shares with every
human body a conative nature (and thus a "virtue" appropriate to its
material configuration). Conatus names a power present in every body:
"Any thing whatsoever, whether it be more perfect or less perfect, will
always be able to persist in existing with that sarne force whereby it begins to exist, so that in this respect all things are equal."· Even a faliing
stone, writes Spinoza. "is endeaVOring, as far as in it lies. to continue in
its motion,'" As Nancy Levene notes, "Spinoza continually stresses this
continuity between human and other beings," for "not only do human
beings not form a separate imperium unto themselves; they do not even
command the imperium, nature, of which they are a part."8
The idea of thing-power bears a family resemblance to Spinoza's conatus, as well as to what Henry David Thoreau called the Wild or that
uncanny presence that met him in the Concord woods and atop Mount
Ktaadn and also resided in/as that monster callled the railroad and that
alien called his Genius. Wildness was a not-quite-human force that
addled and altered human and other bodies. It named an irreducibly
the force of things 3
strange dimension of matter, an out-side. Thing-power is also kin to what
Henl de Vries, in the context of political theology, called "the absolute"
or that "intangible and imponderable" recalcitrance? Though the absolute is often equated with God, especially in theologies emphasizing
dlville omnipotence or radical alterity, de Vries defines it more open-endedly as "that which tends to loosen its ties to existing contexts."'·
This definition makes sense when we look at the etymology of absolute:
ab (off) + solver (to loosen). The absolute is that which is loosened off and
on the loose. When, for example, a Catholic priest performs the act of
absolution, he is the vehicle of a divine agency that loosens sins from
the1r attachment to a particular soul: sins now stand apart, displaced
foreigners living a strange, impersonal life of their own. When de Vries
speaks of the absolute, he thus tries to point to what no speaker could
possibly see, that is, a some-thing that is not an object of knowledge detached or radically free from representation, and thus no-thing
null. Nothing but the force or effectivity of the detachment, that is.
De Vries's notion of the absolute, like the thing-power I will seek to
express, seeks to acknowledge that which refuses to dissolve completely
Into the milieu of human knowledge. But there is also a difference in
emphasis. De Vries conceives this exteriority, this outside. primarily
as"an epistemological limit: in the presence of the absolute, we cannot
�n(lW_ It is from human thinking that the absolute has detached; the
·abSolute names the limits of intelligibility. De Vries's formulations thus
give priority to humans as knOwing bodies, while tending to overlook
things and what they can do. The notion of thing-power aims instead to
.rteod to the it as actant; I will try, impossibly, to name the moment of
independence (from subjectivity) possessed by things, a moment that
must be there, since things do in fact affect other bodies, enhancing or
'i>:eak�ning their power. I will shift from the language of epistemology
to that of ontology, from a focus on an elusive recalcitrance hovering
betweal immanence and transcendence (the absolute) to an active,
earthy, not-quite-human capaciousness (vibrant matter). I will try to
give voice to a vitality intrinsic to materiality, in the process absolving

it is both too allen and too close to see clearly and even though linguistic

The hope is that the story will enhance receptivity to the impersonal life

Thing-Power I: Debris
On a sunny Tuesday morning on 4 June in the grate over the storm drain
to the Chesapeake Bay in front of Sam's Bageis on Cold Spring Lane in
Baltimore, there was:
one large men's black plastic work glove
one dense mat of oak pollen
one unblemished dead rat
one white plastic bottle cap
one smooth stick of wood
Glove. pollen. rat. cap. stick. As I encountered these items. they shimmied back and forth between debris and thing-between. on the one
hand. stuff to ignore. except insofar as it betokened human activity (the
workman's efforts. the litterer's toss. the rat-poisoner's success). and,
on the other hand, stuff that commanded attention in its own right, as
existents in excess of their association with human meanings, habits,
or projects. In the second moment, stuff exhibited its thing-power: it
issued a call. even if I did not quite understand what it was saying. At
the very least. it provoked affects in me: I was repelled by the dead (or
was it merely sleeping?) rat and dismayed by the litter. but I also felt
something else: a nameless awareness of the impossible singularity of
that rat. that configuration of pollen. that otherwise utterly banal. massproduced plastic water-bottle cap.
I was struck by what Stephen Jay Gould called the "excruciating complexityand intractability" of nonhuman bodies.u but. in being struck. I

Teallzcd that the capacity of these bodies was not restricted to a passive
"Introc:bbWt{ but also included the ability to make things happen, to
produce effects. When the materiality of the glove, the rat, the polleo,
the bottle cap, and the stick started to shimmer and spark, it was in part
beGl)lse of the contingent tableau that they formed with each other,
with the street, with the weather that moming, with me. For had the
sun not glinted on the black glove, I might not have seen the rat; had
the rar notbecn there, I might not have noted the bottle cap, and so on.
But th�y were all there just as they were, and so I caught a glimpse of
ao. energetkvitality inside each of these things, things that I generally
conceived as inert. 10 this assemblage, objects appeared as things, that is,
as vivid entities not entirely reducible to the contexts in which (human)
subjects set them, never entirely exhausted by their semiotics. 10 my
enOcunt", with the gutter on Cold Spring Lane, I glimpsed a culture of
thmgs Irreducible to the culture of objects.u I achieved, for a moment,
what Thoreal.l had made his life's goal: to be able, as Thomas Dumm
purs h, "to be surprised by what we see." ,.
This window onto an eccentric out-side was made possible by the
fumuty of that particular assemblage, but also by a certain anticipatory
readloess on my in-side, by a perceptual style open to the appearance of
thing-power. For I came on the glove-pollen-rat-cap-stick with Thoreau
,In my head, who had encouraged me to practice "the discipline of lookIng alwJIys at what is to be seen"; with Spinozas claim that all things
·are "amm.te, albeit in different degrees"; and with Maurice MerleauI'onty, whose Phenomenology of Perception had disclosed for me "an imJDaIlenrar incipient Significance in the living hody [which 1 extends, ...
to th.e whole sensible world" and which had shown me how "our gaze,
prompted by the experience of our own body, will discover in all other
'oblect' the miracle of expression." IS
As I have. already noted, the items on the ground that day were vibrato'Y-at one moment disclosing themselves as dead stuff and at the
next as live presence: junk. then claimanti inert matter, then live wire.

new ones, conceals the Vitality of matter. 10 The Meadowlands, a late
twentieth-century, Thoreauian travelogue of the New Jersey garbage

hills outside Manhattan, Robert Sullivan describes the vitality that persists even in trash:
The ... garbage hiJls are alive .... there are billions of microscopic organisms thriving underground in dark, oxygen-free communities .... After
having ingested the tiniest portion of leItover New Jersey or New York,
these ce1ls then exhale huge underground plumes of carbon dioxide and of
warm moist methane, giant stillborn tIopicaJ winds that seep through the
ground to feed the Meadlowlands' fires, or creep up into the atmosphere,

a black ooze trickling down the slope of the hill. an espresso of refuse. In a
few hours, this stream would find its way down into the ... groundwater of
the Meadowlands; it would mingle with toxic streams .... But in this moment, here at its birth, ... this little seep was pure pollution, a pristine stew
of oil and grease, of cyanide and arsenic, of cadmium, chromium, copper,
lead. nickel. silver, mercury, and zinc. I touched this fluid-my fingertip
was a bluish caramel color-and it was warm and fresh. A few yards away.

Sullivan reminds us that a vital materiality can .never really be thrown
"away," for it continues its activities even as a discarded or unwanted
commodity. For Sullivan that day, as for me on that June morning, thingpower rose from a pile of trash. Not Flower Power, or Black Power, or
Girl Power, but Thing-Power: the curious ability of inanimate things to
animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle.
Thing-Power II: Odcadek's Nonorganic Life
A dead cat, some oak pollen, and a stick of wood stopped me in my
tracks. But so did the plastic glove and the bottle cap: thing-power
arises from bodies inorganic as well as organic. In support of this contention, Manuel De Landa notes how even inorganic matter can "selforganize":

Inorganic matter-energy has a wider range of alternatives for the generation
of structure than just simple phase transitions . . . . In other words, even the

creature, a little person? But if so, his/her/its embodiment seems rather
unnatural: from the center of Odradek's star protrudes a small wooden
crossbar, and "by means of this latter rod ... and one of the points of the
star ... , the whole thing can stand upright as if on two legs.·'·
On the one hand, Uke an active organism, Odradek appears to move
deliberately (he is "extraordinarily nimble") and to speak intelligibly:
"He lurks by turns in the garret, the stairway, the lobbies, the entrance
hall. Often for months on end he is not to be seen; then he has presumably moved into other houses; but he always comes faithfully back to
our house again. Many a time when you go out of the door and he happens just to be leaning directly beneath you against the banisters you
feel inclined to speak to him. Of course, you put no difficult questions to
him, you treat him-he is so diminutive that you cannot help it-rather
like a child. 'Well, what's your narne?' you ask him. 'Odradek; he says.
'And where do you live?' 'No fixed abode; he says and laughs." And yet,
on the other hand, like an inanimate object, Odradek produced a socalled laughter that "has no lungs behind it" and ·sounds rather like the
rustling of fallen leaves. And that is usually the end of the conversatlon.
Even these answers are not always forthcoming; often he stays mute for
a long time, as wooden as his appearance.":!1
Wooden yet lively. verbal yet vegetal. alive yet inert. Odradek is ontolOgically multiple. He/it is a vital materiality and exhibits what Gilles
Deleuze has described as the persistent "hintpf the animate in plants.
and of the vegetable in animals."" The late-nineteenth-century Russian
scientist Vladimir lvaoovich Yernadsky. who also refused any sharp
distinction between life and matter. defined organisms as "special, distributed forms of the common mineral. water .... Emphasizing the
continuity of watery life and r�cks. such as that evident in coal or fossil limestone reefs. Yernadsky noted how these apparently inert strata
are 'traces of bygone biospheres:"" Odradek exposes this continuity of
watery life and rocks; be/it brings to the fore the becoming of things.
Thing-Power Ill: Legal Actants
1 may have met a relative of Odradek while serving on a jury, again in
Baltimore, for a mao on trial for attempted homicide. It was a small
glass vial with an adhesive-covered metal lid: the Gunpowder Residue
the force of things 9
Sampler. Tbis object/witness bad been dabbed on the accused's hand
bours after the sbooting and now offered to the jury its microscopic
evidence that the hand had either fired a gun or been within three feet
of a gun firing. Expert witnesses sbowed the sampler to tbe jury several
times, and with each appearance it exercised more force, until it became vital to the verdict. This composite of glass. skin cells. glue. words,
laws. metals, and human emotions had become an actant. Actant, recal],
is Bruno Latour's term for a source of action; an actant can be human or
not, or, ,most likely, a combination of both, Latour defines it as IOsomething that acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no spe·
cial motivation of human individual actors, nor of humans in general."Z4
An actant is neither an object nor a subject but an "intervener,"zs akin
to the Deleuzean "quasi-causal operator."" An operator is that which.
by virtue of its particular location in an assemblage and the fortuity of
being in the rigbt place at the rigbt time, makes the difference. makes
things bappen. becomes the decisive force catalyzing an event.
Actant and operator are substitute words for what in a more subjectcentered vocabulary are called agents. Agentic capacity is now seen as
differentially distributed across a wider range of ontological types. This
idea is also expressed in the notion of "deodand;' a figure of English law
from about 1200 until it was abolisbed in 1846. In cases of accidental
death or injury to a buman. the nonhuman actant, for example. the carving knife that fell into human flesh or the carriage that trampled the leg
ofa pedestrian-became deodand (literally, "that wbich must be given
to God"). In recognition of its peculiar efficacy (a power that is less masterful tban agency but more active than recalcitrance). the deodand. a
materiality �suspended between human and thing,"27 was surrendered
to the crown to be used (or sold) to compensate for the harm done. According to William Pietz, "any culture must establish some procedure
of compensation, expiation, or punishment to settle the debt created
by unintended human deaths wbose direct cause is not a morally accountable person, but a nonhuman material object. This was the issue
thematized in public discourse by ... the law of deodand.""
There are of course differences between the knife that impales and
the man impaled, between the technician who dabs the sampler and the
sampler. between the array of items in the gutter of Cold Spring Lane
and me, the narrator of their vitality. But I agree with Jobn Frow that
these differences need "to be flattened, read horizontally as a juxtapo-
10 chapter 1
sition rather than vertically as a hierarchy of being. Ifs a feature of our
world that we can and do distinguish ... things from persons. But the
sort of world we live in makes it constantly possible for these two sets of
kinds to exchange properties.'" And to note this fact explicitly, which is
also to begin to experience the relationship between persons and other
materialities more horizontally, is to take a step toward a more ecological senSibility.
Thing-Power IV: Walking, Talking Minerals
Odradek, a gunpowder residue sampler, and some junk on the street
can be fascinating to people and can thus seem to come alive. But is
this evanescence a property of the stuff or of people? Was the thingpower of the debris I encountered but a function of the subjective and
intersubjective connotations, memories, and aff ects that had accumulated around my ideas of these items? Was the real agent of my temporary immobilization on the street that day humanity, that is, the cultural
meanings of "rat," "plastic," and "wood" in conjunction with my own
idiosyncratic biography? It could be. But what if the swarming activity
inside my head was itself an instance of the vital materiality that also
constituted the trash?
I have been trying to raise the volume on th� vitality of materiality
per se, pursuing this task so far by focusing on nonhuman bodies, by,
that is, depicting them as actants rather than as objects. But the case
for matter as active needs also to readjust the status of human actants:
not by denying humanity's awesome, awful powers, but by presenting
these powers as evidence of our own constitution as vital materiality. In
other words. human power is itself a kind of thing-power. At one level
this claim is uncontroversial: it is easy to acknowledge that humans
are composed of various material parts (the minerality of our bones, or
the metal of our blood, or the electricity of our neurons). But it is more
challenging to conceive of these materials as lively and self-organizing.
rather than as passive or mechanical means under the direction of
something nonmaterial, that is, an active soul or mind.
Perhaps the claim to a vitality intrinsic to matter itself becomes more
plaUSible if one takes a long view of time. If one adopts the perspective
the force of things 11
of evolutionary rather than biographical time, for example, a mineral
efficacy becomes visible. Here is De Landa's account of the emergence
of our bones: "Soft tissue (gels and aerosols, muscle and nerve) reigned
supreme until 5000 million years ago. At that point. some of the can·
glomerations of Beshy matter-energy that made up life underwent a
sudden mineralization, and a new material for constructing living crea�
tures emerged: bone_ It is almost as if the mineral world that had served
as a substratum for the emergence of biological creatures was reasserting itself_"" Mineralization names the creative agency by which bone
was produced, and bones then "made new forms of movement control
possible among animals. freeing them from many constraints and liter·
ally setting them Into motion to conquer every available niche in the air,
in water, and on land_"" In the long and slow time of evolution, then,
mineral material appears as the mover and shaker, the active power, and
the human beings, with their much-lauded capacity for self-directed
action, appear as its product." Vernadsky seconds this view in his description of humankind as a particularly potent mix of minerals: "What
struck [Vernadsky] most was that the material of Earth's crust has been
packaged into myriad moving beings whose reproduction and growth
build and break down matter on a global scale_ People, for example,
redistribute and concentrate oxygen ... and otber elements of Earth's
crust Into two-legged, upright forms that have an amazing propensity to
wander across, dig Into and In countless other ways alter Earth's surface.
We are walking, talking minerals.""
Kafka, De Landa, and Vemadsky suggest that buman individuals are
themselves composed of vital materials, that our powers are thlngpower. These vital materialists do Dot claim that there are no differences
between humans and bones, only that there is no necessity to describe
these differences in a way that places humans at the ontological center
or hierarcbical apex. Humanity can be distinguished, instead, as JeanFran�ois Lyotard suggests, as a particularly rich and complex collection
of materials: "Humankind is taken for a complex material system; consciousness, for an effect of language; and language for a highly complex
material system."" Richard Rorty sirnilarlyde6nes humans as very complex animals, rather than .s animals "with an extra added ingredient
called 'intellect' or 'the rational soul:""
The fear is that in failing to affirm human uniqueness, such views
12 chapter 1
authorize the treatment of people as mere thingsi in other words, that
a strong distinction between subjects and objects is needed to prevent
the instrumentalization of humans. Yes. such critics continue, objects
possess a certain power of action (as when bacteria or pharmaceuticals enact hostile or symbiotic projects inside the human body), and
yes, some subject-an-subject objectifications are permissible (as when
persons consent to use and be used as a means to sexual pleasure), but
the ontolOgical divide between persons and things must remain lest one
have no moral grounds for privileging man over germ or for condemning
pernicious forms of human-an-human instrumentalization (as when
powerful humans exploit illegal, poor, young, or otherwise weaker
humans).
How can the vital materialist respond to this important concern?
First, by acknowledging that the framework of subject versus object has
indeed at times worked to prevent or ameliorate human suffering and to
promote human happiness or well-being. Second, by noting that its successes come at the price of an instrumentalization of nonhuman nature
that can itself be unethical and can itself undermine long-term human
interests. Third, by pointing out that the Kantian imperative to treat
humanity always as an end-in-itself and never merely as a means does
not have a stellar record of success in preventing human suffering or
promoting human well-being: it is important to raise the question of its
actual, historical efficacy in order to open up space for forms of ethical
practice that do not rely upon the image of an intrinsically hierarchical
order of things. Here the materialist speaks of promoting healthy and
enabling instrumentalizations, rather than of treating people as ends-inthemselves, because to face up to the compound nature of the human
self is to find it difficult even to make sense of the notion of a Single
end-in-itself. What instead appears is a swarm of competing ends being
pursued Simultaneously in each individual, some ofwbich are healthy to
the whole, some of which are not. Here the vital materialist, taking a cue
&om Nietzsche's and Spinoz"s ethics, favors phYSiolOgical over moral
descriptors because she fears that moralism can itself bec
